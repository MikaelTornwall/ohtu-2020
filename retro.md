# Retrospective techniques

## Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel

To get comprehensive feedback, a wheel with five categories is used. These categories include Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of. Start encourages discussion about what should be started and Stop of what maybe should not be continued anymore. Continue includes the things that are working well. More of and less of include things that should be done more/less. This facilitates discussion and feedback from several viewpoints.

## Glad, Sad, Mad

Each team member lists things that they noticed during the last sprint. These things are categorized under three categories, Glad, Sad and Mad. Glad includes positive things, Sad negative things and Mad includes things were considered irritating, annoying, etc., but here the focus is on external issues to the team. Then participants vote on these things and they are being discussed in a prioritized order from the highest to the lowest vote.
